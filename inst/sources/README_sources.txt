README

These are sources acquired over a period of time from Tim A. Cohn via written
communication between William H. Asquith and John F. England. Several sources
are clearly related to low outliers and scripts for article generation.
Other sources "P3_***_***(R).txt" contain low outlier code but the bulk of which
is used for log-Pearson type III, expected moments algorithm (EMA) computation
of peak-streamflow frequency. This extra code is not needed for the MGBT package
and IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED CANONICAL OF LPIII-EMA-like computations! Please
contact John F. England or William H. Asquith for further details.
